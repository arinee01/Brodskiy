For here yourself is the last thing you care to see. On my first sojourns I often felt surprised, catching my own frame, dressed or naked, in the open wardrobe; after a while I began to wonder about this place's edenic or afterlife-like effects upon one's self- awareness. Somewhere along the line, I even developed a theory of excessive redundancy , of the mirror absorbing the body absorbing the city. The net result is, obviously, mutual negation. A reflection cannot possibly care for a reflection. The city is narcissistic enough to turn your mind into an amalgam, unburdening it ofits depths. With their similar effect on your purse, hotels and pensioties therefore feel very congenial. After a two-week stay even at offseason rates you become both broke and selfless, like a Buddhist monk. At a certain age and in a certain line of work, selflessness is welcome, not to say imperative." .

No matter what sort of pills, and how many, you've got to swallow this morning, you feel it's not over for you yet. No matter, by the same token, how autonomous you are, how niuch you've been betrayed, how thorough and dispiriting is your self- knowledge, you assume there is still hope for you, or at least a future. (Hope, said Francis Bacon, is a good breakfast but a bad supper.) This optimism derives from the haze, from the prayer part of it, especially if it is time for breakfast. On days like this, the city indeed acquires a porcelain aspect, what with all its zinc-covered cupolas resembling teapots or upturned cups, and the tilted profile ofcanipaniles clinking like abandoned spoons and melting in the sky. Not to mention the seagulls and pigeons, now sharpening into focus, now melting into air. I should say that, good though this place is for honeymoons, I've often thought it should be tried for divorces alsoboth in progress and already accomplished. There is no better backdrop for rapture to fade into; whether right or wrong, no egoist can star for long in this porcelain setting by crystal water, for it steals the show. I am aware, of course, ofthe disastrous consequence the above suggestions may have for hotel rates here, even in winter.

(Everyone would understand this, save Freudians, or Muslims believing in the veil. But then again, that may explain why among Muslims there are so many astronomers. Besides, the veil is a great social planning device, since it ensures every female a man regardless of her appearance. Worst come to worst, it guarantees that the first-night shock is at least mutual. Still, for all the Oriental motifs in Venetian architecture, Muslims in this city are the most infrequent visitors.) In any case, whichever comes first - reality or dream - one's notion of afterlife in this city appears to be well taken care of by its clearly paradisaical visual texture.

That this doesn't happen suggests that the affair is not entirely human; that something we've got no idea or control of interferes. That there is an agency which is not subject to ourchronology or, for that matter, our sense of virtue. Hence all these attempts to foretell or figure out one's future, hence one's reliance on physicians and gypsies, which intensifies once we are ill or in trouble, and which is but an attempt at domesticating - or demonizing - the divine. The same applies to our sentiment for beauty, natural and man-made alike, since the infinite can be appreciated only by the finite.

I simply think that water is the image of time, and every New Year's Eve, in somewhat pagan fashion, I try to find myself near water, preferably near a sea or an ocean, to watch the emergence of a new helping, a new cupful of time from it. I am not looking for a naked maiden riding on a shell; I am looking for either a cloud or the crest of a wave hitting the shore at midnight.

Because of the scarcity of space, people exist here in cellular proximity to one another, and life evolves with the immanent logic of gossip. One's territorial imperative in this city is circumscribed by water; the window shutters bar not so niuch daylight or noise (which is minimal here) as what may emanate from inside. When they are opened, shutters resemble the wings of angels prying into someone's sordid affairs, and like the spacing of the statues on cornices, human interplay here takes on theaspects of jewelry or, better yet, filigree. In these parts one is both more secretive and better informed than the police in tyrannies. No sooner do you cross the threshold of your apartment, especially in winter, than you fall prey to every conceivable surmise, fantasy, rumor. If you've got company, the next day at the grocery or newsagent you may meet a stare of biblical probing unfathomable, you would think, in a Catholic country. If you sue someone here, or vice versa, you must hire a lawyer on the outside. A traveler, of course, enjoys this sort of thing; the native doesn't. What a painter sketches, or an amateur photographs, is no fun for the citizen. Yet insinuation as a principle of city planning (which notion locally emerges only with the benefit of hindsight) is better than any modern grid and in tune with the local canals, taking their cue from water, which, like the chatter behind you, never ends. In that sense, brick is undoubtedly more potent than marble, although both are unassailable for a stranger. However, once or twice over theseseventeen years, I've managed to insinuate myself into a Venetian inner sanctum, into that beyond-the-anialgam labyrinth Regnier described in Provincial Entertainments. It happened in such a roundabout way that I can't even recall the details now, for I could not keep tabs on all those twists and turns that led to my passage into this labyrinth at the time.

The umpteenth himself, the last in the line, after decades and decades of waiting, had finally got it, to the great consternation of the other - apparently numerous - members of the family. He was no navy man; he was a bit of a playwright and a bit of a painter. For the moment, though, the most obvious thing about this forty-year-old  - a slim, short creature in a gray double- breasted suit of very good cut - was that he was quite sick. His skin looked post-hepatitis, parchment yellow - or perhaps it was just an ulcer.

The cherubs' faces were terribly grotesque: they all had these corrupt, lecherous grins as they stared - very keenly - downward upon the bed. They reminded me of that stable of giggling youths downstairs; and then I noticed a portable TV set in the corner of this otherwise absolutely bare room. I pictured the major domo entertaining his choice in this chamber: a writhing island ofnaked flesh amid a sea of linen, under the scrutiny of the dust- covered gypsum masterpiece. Oddly enough, I felt no repulsion. On the contrary, I felt that from time's point of view such entertainmenthere could only seem appropriate, as it generated nothing. After all, for three centuries, nothing here reigned supreme. Wars, revolutions, great discoveries, geniuses, plagues never entered here due to a legal problem. Causality was canceled, since its human carriers strolled in this perspective only in a caretaker capacity, once in a few years, if that. So the little wriggling shoal in the linen sea was, in fact, in tune with the premises, since it couldn't in nature give birth to anything.

Other than that, the room was quite bare. The light in it wasn't much better than in the gallery; I'd made out a desk and a large faded globe.

Having grown unaccustomed over the centuries to reflecting anything but the wall opposite, the mirrors were quite reluctant to return one's visage, out of either greed or impotence, and when they tried, one's features would come back incomplete. I thought, I begin to understand Regnier. From room to room, as we proceeded through the enfilade, I saw myself in those frames less and less, getting back more and more darkness. Gradual subtraction, I thought to myself; how is this going to end? And it ended in the tenth or eleventh room.

Of course, the \"Embankment ofthe Incurables\" harks back to the plague, to the epidemics that used to sweep this city half clean century after century with a census taker's regularity. The name conjures the hopeless cases, not so much strolling along as scattered about on the flagstones, literally expiring, shrouded, waiting to be carted - or, rather, shipped away. Torches, fumes, gauze masks preventing inhalation, rustling of monks' frocks and habits, soaring black capes, candles. Gradually the funereal procession turns into a carnival, or indeed a promenade, where a mask would have to be worn, since in this city everybody knows everybody. Add to this, tubercular poets and composers; add to this, men of moronic convictions or aesthetes hopelessly enamored of this place - and the Embankment might earn its name, reality might catch up with language. And add to this that the interplay between plague and literature (poetry in particular, and Italian poetry especially) was quite intricate from thethreshold. That Dante's descent into the netherworld owes as much to Homer's and Virgil's - episodic scenes, after all, in the Iliad and the Aeneid - as to Byzantine medieval literature about cholera, with its traditional conceit of premature burial and subsequent peregrination of the soul. Overzealous agents of the netherworld bustling around the cholera-stricken city would often zero in on a badly dehydrated body,put their lips to his nostrils, and suck away his life spirit, thereby proclaiming him dead and fit to be buried. Once underneath, the individual would pass through infinite halls and chambers, pleading that he has been consigned to the realm of the dead unjustly and seeking redress. Upon obtaining it - usually by facing a tribunal presided over by Hippocrates - he would return full of stories about those he had bumped into in the halls and chambers below: kings, queens, heroes, famous or infamous mortals of his time, repentant, resigned, defiant. Sounds familiar? Well, so much for the suggestive powers of the métier. One never knows what engenders what: an experience a language, or a language an experience. Both are capable of generating quite a lot. When one is badly sick, one imagines all sorts of consequences and developments which, for all we know, won't ever take place. Is this metaphoric thinking? The answer, I believe, is yes. Except that when one is sick, one hopes, even against hope, to get cured, the illness to stop. The end of an illness thus is the end of its metaphors. A metaphor - or, to put it more broadly, language itself - is by and large open-ended, it craves continuum: an afterlife, if you will. In other words (no pun intended), metaphor is incurable. Add then to all of this yourself, a carrier of this métier, or of this virus - in fact, of a couple of them, sharpening your teeth for a third - shuffling on a windy night along the Fondamenta, whose name proclaims your diagnosis regardless of the nature of your malady." .

The Greek version rings, though, a better bell, since the winner gets nothing, because the slayer and the slain are related. The monster, after all, was the prize's half brother; in any case, he was half brother to the hero's eventual wife. Ariadne and Phacdra were sisters, and for all we know, the brave Athenian had them both. In fact, with an eye on marrying into the Cretan king's family, he niight have accepted the murderous commission to make the family more respectable. As granddaughters of Helios, the girls were supposed to be pure and shining; their names suggested as much. Why, even their mother, Pasiphae, was, for all her dark urges, Blindingly Bright. And perhaps she yielded to those dark urges and did it with the bull precisely to prove that nature neglects the majority principle, since the bull's horns suggest the moon. Perhaps she was interested in chiaroscuro rather than in bestiality and eclipsed the bull for purely optical reasons. And the fact that the bull, whose symbolism-laden pedigree ran all the way back to cave paintings, was blind enough to mistake the artificial cow Daedalus built for Pasiphae on this occasion is her proof that her ancestry still holds the upper hand in the system of causality, that Helios' light, refracted in her, Pasiphae, is still - after four children (two fine daughters and two good-for-nothing boys) - blindingly bright. As far as the principle ofcausality is concerned, it should be added that the main hero in this story is precisely Daedalus, who, apart from a very convincing cow, built - this time on the king's request - the very labyrinth in which the bull-headed offspring and his slayer got to face each other one day, with disastrous consequences for the former. In a manner of speaking, the whole business is Daedalus' brain child, the labyrinth especially, as it resembles a brain. In a manner of speaking, everybody is related to everybody, the pursuer to the pursued, at least. Small wonder, then, that one's ineanderings through the streets of this city, whose biggest colony for nearly three centuries was the island of Crete, feels somewhat tautological, especially as light fades - that is, especially as its pasiphaian, ariadnan, and phaedran properties fail.

It is the last to shut down when the body is falling asleep. It stays open when the body is stricken with paralysis or dead. The eye keeps registering reality even when there is no apparent reason for doing this, and under all circumstances. The question is: Why? And the answer is: Because the environment is hostile. Eyesight is the instrument of adjustment to an environment which remains hostile no matter how well you have adjusted to it. The hostility of the environment grows proportionately to the length of your presence in it, and I am speaking not of old age only. In short, the eye is looking for safety. That explains the eye's predilection for art in general and Venetian art in particular. That explains the eye's appetite for beauty, as well as beauty's own existence. For beauty is solace, since beauty is safe. It doesn't threaten you with murder or make you sick. A statue of Apollo doesn't bite, nor will Carpaccio's poodle. When the eye fails to find beauty - alias solace - it commands the body to create it, or, failing that, adjusts itself to perceive virtue in ugliness. In the first instance, it relies on human genius; in the second, it draws on one's reservoir of humility. The latter is in greater supply, and like every majority tends to make laws. Let's have an illustration; let's take a young maiden. At a certain age one eyes passing maidens without applied interest, without aspiring to mount them. Like a TV set left switched on in an abandoned apartment, the eye keeps sending in images of all these 5'8'' miracles, complete with light chestnut hair, Perugino ovals, gazelle eyes, nurse-like bosoms, wasp waists, dark-green velvet dresses, and razor-sharp tendons. An eye may zero in on them in a church at someone's wedding or, worse still, in a bookstore's poetry section. Reasonably farsighted or resorting to the counsel of the ear, the eye may learn their identities (which come with names as breathtaking as, say, Arabella Ferri) and, alas, their dishearteningly firm romantic affiliations. Regardless of such data's uselessness, the eye keeps collecting it. In fact, the more useless the data, the sharper the focus. The question is why, and the answer is that beauty is always external; also, that it is the exception to the rule. That's what - its location and its singularity - sends the eye oscillating wildly or - in militant humility's parlance - roving. For beauty is where the eye rests. Aesthetic sense is the twin of one's instinct for self-preservation and is more reliable than ethics. Aesthetics' main tool, the eye, is absolutely autonomous.

Because one is finite, a departure from this place always feels final; leaving it behind is leaving it forever. For leaving is a banishment of the eye to the provinces of the other senses; at best, to the crevices and crevasses of the brain. For the eye identifies itself not with the body it belongs to but with the object of its attention. And to the eye, for purely optical reasons, departure is not the body leaving the city but the city abandoning the pupil. Likewise, disappearance of the beloved, especially a gradual one, causes grief no matter who, and for what peripatetic reason, is actually in motion.

That was a Calvinoesque idea, and who knows, as an upshot of space travel, that may yet come to pass. As it is, apart from the moon landing, this century may be best remembered by leaving this place intact, by just letting it be. I, for one, would advise even against gentle interference. Of course, film festivals and book fairs are in tune with the flickering of the canals' surface, with their curlicue, sirocco-perused scribblings. And of course, turning this place into a capital of scientific research would be a palatable option, especially taking into account the likely advantages of the local phosphorus-rich diet for any mental endeavor. The same bait could be used for moving the EEC headquarters here from Brussels and the European parliament from Strasbourg. And of course, a better solution would be to give this city and some of its environs the status of a national park. Yet I would argue that the idea of turning " .

As a result you shiver and go to bed with your woolen socks on, because radiators keep their erratic cycles here even in hotels. Only alcohol can absorb the polar lightning shooting through your body as you set your foot on the marble floor, slippers or no slippers, shoes or no shoes. If you work in the evening you burn parthenons of candles - not for ambience or better light, but for their illusory warmth; or else you move to the kitchen, light the gas stove, and shut the door. Everything emanates cold, the walls especially. Windows you don't mind because you know what to expect from them. In fact, they only pass the cold through, whereas walls store it. I remember once spending the month of January in an apartment on the fifth floor of a house near the church of Fava. The place belonged to a descendant of none other than Ugo Foscolo. The owner was a forest engineer or some such thing, and was, naturally, away on business. The apartment wasn't that big: two rooms, sparsely furnished. The ceiling, though, was extraordinarily high and the windows were correspondingly tall. There were six or seven of them, as the apartment was a corner one. In the middle of the second week the heating went off. This time I was not alone, and my comrade-in-arms and I drew lots as to who would have to sleep by the wall. \"Why should I always go to the wall?\" she'd ask beforehand. \"Because I'm a victim?\" And her mustard-and-honey eyes would darken with incredulity upon losing.

No matter how solid its substitute the deck under your feet, on water you are somewhat more alert than ashore, your faculties are more poised. On water, for instance, you never get absentminded the way you do in the street: your legs keep you and your wits in constant check, as if you were some kind of compass. Well, perhaps what sharpens your wits while traveling on water is indeed a distant, roundabout echo of the good old chor- dates. At any rate, your sense of the other on water gets keener, as though heightened by a common as well as a mutual danger.
